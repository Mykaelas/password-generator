# password-generator

For this project we were given some base HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to go off of. The client wanted for the application to be a password generator and for it to assign the user with a random password once they have filled out the prompts. 

I used the while loop along with if statements in order to create the random loop function for the different questions asked. The most important one was coding the desired length that the user wanted. I had to make sure that I coded it so that it was more than 8 but less than 128 characters. I also added in a variable information bottom area that lists the different string types and variables. ![password generator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101831653/173721248-15a8d2f0-3d69-48c5-a51c-865814e0e41a.png)
